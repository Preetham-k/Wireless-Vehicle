# Wireless-Vehicle

Project creator : Preetham Ganesh Kamisetty

Modules Used : Arduino, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, SR-05 Ultrasonic Sensor and L298N Motor Driver Module.

Code : Codded in Arduino IDE.

A vehicle is developed with Simple hardware architecture using Arduino, HC-05 and SR-04 modules.

-> L298N Motor Driver Module is used to drive the Vehicle. The communication exchange takes place over Arduino and HC-05.

->A buzzer is attached to the vehicle. It buzzes when there is any obstacle present in the pathway which is detected by SR-04 Ultra Sonic Sensor.

->Arduino Code is developed and is upload into the board to integrate everything.

-> Developed an application in MIT App inventor to control the vehicle through Mobile Device.

-> It's easy to control and efficient low-cost design.


**NOTE: Code and Detailed description of the Project are provided in the project document.
